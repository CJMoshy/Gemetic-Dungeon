# Gem-etic Dungeon
This is the final project work for CMPM 147 at UCSC. This program is a procedurally generated dungeon that uses machine learning to predict 'genetic' sequences that seed future dungeons.

# How It Works
The software is initially seeded with a chosen seed from the user. This is then fed through a sequential neural network which predicts a pseudo genetic 8-character sequence. This predicted sequence is then used as the primary argument for a procedurally generated dungeon.
